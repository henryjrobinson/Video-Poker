# Video Poker Project Plan

## Completed Work

### Core Functionality
- Implemented pattern-based calculator for determining optimal play
- Added identity-based calculator as an alternative approach
- Implemented comprehensive pay table handling with multiple variations (9/6, 8/5, 7/5, 6/5)
- Created foundational UI components in React/TypeScript

### Edge Case Implementation
- **Core Edge Cases**:
  - ✅ Priority conflicts (Low Pair vs. 4 to a Flush, 3 to a Royal vs. Low Pair)
  - ✅ Card combinations (Overlapping Draws, Multiple High Cards)
  - ✅ Suit-specific cases (Royal Potential in Multiple Suits)
  - ✅ Deceptive hands (Almost Royal but Better Play exists, Full House with Royal Potential)

- **Advanced Edge Cases**:
  - ✅ Pay Table Variations (9/6, 8/5, etc.) with adjusted EV calculations
  - ✅ Special Kicker Considerations for high pairs
  - ✅ Ace-Low Straight Edge Cases
  - ✅ Gap Position Significance for inside straights
  - ✅ Sequential Royal Draws optimization
  - ✅ High-Card Ranking Subtleties

### Testing
- ✅ Implemented Jest testing framework configuration
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suite for all edge cases
- ✅ Added tests for all basic poker patterns
- ✅ Developed test utilities for simplifying test creation
- ✅ Fixed existing tests to match implementation behavior

## Next Steps

### Cloud Deployment Phase
1. **Preparation**
   - Create deployment configuration for Netlify/Vercel
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
   - Configure environment variables for production

2. **Deployment**
   - Deploy application to Netlify/Vercel
   - Set up custom domain (if applicable)
   - Configure SSL certificate
   - Implement monitoring and logging

3. **Post-Deployment Validation**
   - Verify all functionality works in production environment
   - Run performance tests
   - Check mobile responsiveness
   - Validate accessibility compliance

### User Testing Phase
1. **Participant Recruitment**
   - Identify target users (casual players, experts, etc.)
   - Create signup form for testers
   - Establish testing schedule

2. **Testing Methodology**
   - Define key scenarios to test
   - Create survey/feedback forms
   - Establish metrics for success
   - Set up analytics tracking

3. **Feedback Collection**
   - Implement in-app feedback mechanism
   - Schedule user interviews
   - Create heatmap tracking for UI interactions
   - Set up error tracking and reporting

4. **Analysis and Iteration**
   - Analyze feedback and metrics
   - Prioritize improvements
   - Implement critical fixes
   - Plan feature enhancements based on user input

## Future Enhancement Ideas
- Mobile app version with native features
